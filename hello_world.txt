How Many People Have Walked on the Moon? And say hello to the world?

Ask someone if they know the names of the astronauts who have walked on the Moon, 
and most people would be able to list Neil Armstrong, and maybe even Buzz Aldrin. 


But can you name the rest of the Apollo astronauts who made it down to the lunar surface? How many people have walked on the Moon?

In total twelve people have walked on the Moon. 
Besides Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin – who were the first two astronauts to leave their bootprints on the Moon — there were also Pete Conrad, 
Alan Bean, Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, David Scott, James Irwin, John Young, Charles Duke, Eugene Cernan, and Harrison Schmitt.

Interestingly, out of the dozen people who walked on the Moon, no one ever did it more than once. Here’s some additional information about 
the men who walked on the Moon and their missions: 

Apollo 11 – 2 people On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the Moon. 
He was soon followed by Buzz Aldrin. In a nail-biting landing, Armstrong had to manually fly the Lunar Module past the intended landing spot,
which he could see was filled with boulders. He landed safely in Tranquility Base with Aldrin keeping an eye on the altitude and velocity, 
along with a dangerously low fuel tank. In total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface 
(both inside their Eagle lunar module and walking on the Moon) for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds and were outside walking in the Sea of Tranquility for 
just 2 hours, 31 minutes and 40 seconds. 

During their EVA, they collected rocks, planted the US flag, and deployed a seismograph and an experiment called 
the Lunar Ranging Retroreflector – a reflective device that measures the distance between the Earth and the Moon using lasers from Earth — which is still in use today.
